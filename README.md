# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation-with-YOLO-11-and-SAM2.
This project combines YOLO for brain tumor detection and SAM for precise segmentation of MRI images. It automates tumor localization and segmentation, providing valuable insights for healthcare professionals in diagnosing brain tumors. The pipeline enhances medical image analysis, enabling faster and more accurate tumor detection and segmentation.

# Project Overview
This project aims to detect and segment brain tumors from MRI images using a combination of object detection (YOLO) and segmentation (SAM2) techniques. The model identifies tumor regions accurately, which can assist medical professionals in diagnosis and treatment planning.
